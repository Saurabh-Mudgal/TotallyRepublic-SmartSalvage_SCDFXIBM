## <b>The Idea</b> ðŸ’¡
We have developed an <b>interactive</b> simulation of a modern Singapore, built using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to help demonstrate how IoT can efficiently deal with crises and save precious resources. 
## Our simulation is live and can be accessed [here](https://disasteravertsing.mybluemix.net/).

## Getting started
The <b>easiest</b> way to try out a demo of our simulation is to click the link [here](https://disasteravertsing.mybluemix.net/). Alternatively, you can download the files above and run `index.html` in a browser.

## Our Architecture
This model simulates moving vehicles and crowds in a day-to-day scenario with various IoT devices implemented:
<ul>
<li>Fire Alarms</li>
<li>Multi-purpose autonomous robots</li>
<li>Smart light posts </li>
<li>Area specific technology such as:
<ul>
<li>Cameras enabled with image recognition technology</li>
<li>Temperature sensors</li>
<li>Loudspeakers</li>
<li>Electronic Signboards</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The model uses <b>fire ðŸ”¥</b> as an example and allows the user to pick a starting location. On detecting the fire, numerous steps are taken to ensure the safety of the occupants and minimise damage to property. We propose the use of IBM Watson IoT and Cloud Hosting to allow rapid access and processing of data.

## <b>Our Efficient Solution</b> âœ”

By leveraging Singapore's technological advances and the cross-communication between various IoT devices, the following steps are simulated:
<ol>
<li><b> Trigerring of the fire alarm and alerting of members of the building</b></li>
<li><b> Re-routing of autonomous robots to:</b>
<ol>
<li>Assess the extent of fire using temperature sensors and camera feed (cross-checked with CCTV footage using image recognition technology)</li>
<li>Possible dispension of flame retardants and extinguishers</li>
<li>Assessment of any injuries by scoping the floors</li>
<li>Dispension of first-aid and gas masks if necessary</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b> Clearance of immediate radius outside building</b>
<ol>
<li>Specific coloring of smart street lamps to show the safe route to the assembly point</li>
<li>Electric signboards to show directions and alert the public</li>
<li>Loudspeakers to convey announcements</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b> Re-routing of vehicles to clear direct path from fire station to location of fire</b></li>
</ol>
